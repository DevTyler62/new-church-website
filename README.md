# Updated Church Website

This site is an updated version from the first one I had completed. The previous one was done 6 months ago from the time of writing this. It was my first time doing a site
from scratch, being based on similar to one I had done within a Udemy course I had done. 

This new site was developed using SCSS which is new to me so it was something for me to practice with. I have also used some better ways to format the content on the page
so it makes it easier to move around or speeds up the process when is comes to making the site responsive. 

I also learned the basics of Figma so I had used that to make a design of what I was looking for before I actually went to coding up the site fully.

While also using Figma to design the layout of the website I had put in some icons to use for the cards I was going to use. I then exported them as SVG's so then I was able to 
animate parts of the icon to make things more intresting. They are some small animations but I had enjoyed the process of getting them to work they way i wanted them to.

This is a link to a PDF of the design I made up within Figma. Some things are a bit different from the design to the actual site.

Since heroku is being used it may take some time for the site to load due to the fact that there is no traffic to keep it running all of the time.
I also have used heroku since I wanted to shorten my SVGs that I was using an instead of putting the entire SVG file into my HTML I used PHP to
route to the locations of those files and include them that way which says a lot of space within my HTML.
