# Updated Church Website

This site is an updated version from the first one I had completed. The previous one was done 6 months ago from the time of writing this. It was my first time doing a site
from scratch, being based on similar to one I had done within a Udemy course I had done. 

This new site was developed using SCSS which is new to me so it was something for me to practice with. I have also used some better ways to format the content on the page
so it makes it easier to move around or speeds up the process when is comes to making the site responsive. 

I also learned the basics of Figma so I had used that to make a design of what I was looking for before I actually went to coding up the site fully.

While also using Figma to design the layout of the website I had put in some icons to use for the cards I was going to use. I then exported them as SVG's so then I was able to 
animate parts of the icon to make things more intresting. They are some small animations but I had enjoyed the process of getting them to work they way i wanted them to.
